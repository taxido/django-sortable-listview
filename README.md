django-sortable-listview
========================
An extension of django's ListView that provides sorting.

Features:
- Works with django's built in pagination.
- Contains templates & css for pagination and sort buttons (or just use the context_data and build your own).
- Adds an arrow to show the sort direction on the active sort.
- Knows what the next sort is (i.e. if you're already sorted by title in one direction, clicking on the title button/link again will sort it in the other direction).
- Lets you specify default sort for your list (defaults to -id) and for each of the sortable fields.
- Modifies the queryset, so your database does your sorting.
- Maintains additional query strings (configurable)

============

    * Python (2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4)
    * Django (1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7)

(Tested against the latest version of each e.g. currently Python 2.7.4 & Django 1.5.12)


Install
=======
Using pip::
